    Electron ptychography has revolutionized atomic-scale imaging by providing exceptional contrast for both light and heavy elements. While current technology can achieve remarkable lateral resolution below 0.5 Ångstroms, the depth (axial) resolution has remained limited to several nanometers—until now.

    In this work, we introduce multi-slice ptychographic electron tomography, a breakthrough technique that achieves true 3D atomic-resolution imaging beyond conventional depth of field limits. Using a Co₃O₄ nanocube as our test subject, we demonstrate:

    - Unprecedented 3D resolution: 2Å axial and 0.7Å transverse resolution
    - Large imaging volume: (18.2 nm)³
    - 13.5× improvement in depth resolution compared to existing methods

    This advancement significantly expands the capabilities of high-resolution electron microscopy, opening new possibilities for studying larger material volumes at atomic resolution. 
    
    Our ongoing research focuses on further refinements to enable 3D imaging of individual weakly scattering atoms, promising even more detailed insights into material structures.
